# ðŸŒ± Plant Health Check â€” Leaf Detection & Disease Classification

This project is a **plant disease detection system** with a **GUI** built using **PyQt5**.\
It uses **YOLOv11** for **leaf detection** and a **TensorFlow/Keras-based classifier** for detecting leaf diseases.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Leaf Detection**: Detects leaves in an image using YOLOv11n or YOLOv11x.
- **Disease Classification**: Classifies each detected leaf as *healthy* or *diseased* using:
    - A **custom CNN** model, or
    - An **EfficientNetB3**-based model.
- **GUI Application**:
    - Load images from file.
    - Run detection and classification with one click.
    - Display results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
- **Dataset Downloader**: Download and prepare training datasets automatically.
- **Model Training Notebooks**:
    - YOLO11n & YOLO11x training for leaf detection.
    - Custom CNN & EfficientNetB3 training for disease classification.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

You can use the included `dataset_downloader.py` to download the required datasets for:

- **Leaf detection** (YOLOv11 training)
- **Disease classification** (Custom CNN / EfficientNetB3)

(Since Datasets are being downloaded using Kaggle, ensure Kaggle API credentials are set.
Place kaggle.json in ~/.kaggle/ or set environment variables.
The kaggle.json file (API token) can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/account)

Run:

```bash
python3 dataset_downloader.py
```

---

## ðŸ–¥ Running the Application

After installing dependencies and downloading models:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

- Click **Load Image** to select a plant image.
- Click **Detect Disease** to run YOLO detection + classification.
- The results will be shown in the image preview and in the text box.

---

## ðŸ§  Training Models

Training scripts are provided as Jupyter notebooks:

- **leaf_detector_YOLO11n / leaf_detector_YOLO11x**: For leaf detection.
- **diease_classifier_CustomCNN / diease_classifier_EfficientNetB3**: For disease classification.

You can run them in **Google Colab** or locally.
